# VIVIDUS Component Library for Svelte.JS

Read more about the library in the main repo [here](../README.md)...

The svelte version currently has the following components:

## Components

- [Abbr](./src/lib/components/Abbr.md): a **higher level version** of HTML's `abbr` element that requires _less writing_, and more "<u>lively</u>" transition. With multiple customizations to the ccomponent display and behavior.

## Planned Components

- [RadialFlickMenu](./src/lib/components/RadialFlickMenu.md): a **higher level _alternative_** to HTML's `select` element that provides smoother and a slickier interaction for the end user to select an item of a given short-list.

### Adding More

For more info on how to add more components to the library, please refer to the [Adding More Components](./Adding-New-Components.md) doc.
