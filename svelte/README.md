# VIVIDUS Component Library for Svelte.JS

Vividus is a "lively" compnent library, Its main purpose is to add life and modernization to standard HTML elements, or add higher levels of modernity to them.
All componenets try to provide accessibility, and be accessible by default, by using semantic markup.

## Components

- [Abbr](./dist/components/Abbr.md): a **higher level version** of HTML's `abbr` element that requires _less writing_, and more "<u>lively</u>" transition. With multiple customizations to the ccomponent display and behavior.

## Planned Components

- [RadialFlickMenu](./dist/components/RadialFlickMenu.md): a **higher level _alternative_** to HTML's `select` element that provides smoother and a slickier interaction for the end user to select an item of a given short-list.
